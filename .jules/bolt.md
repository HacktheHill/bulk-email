## 2024-08-19 - Avoid uncompiled html-to-text in loops
**Learning:** `html-to-text` parses options and compiles selectors on every `convert()` call. Doing this inside a large loop (e.g., iterating through every recipient in a campaign) causes a massive performance bottleneck due to decision tree compilation.
**Action:** Always extract `compile` from `html-to-text` outside loops, creating a compiled function to process multiple HTML inputs efficiently.

## 2023-08-20 - Delay Expensive Crypto Hashing
**Learning:** Checking fast O(1) `Set` lookups before calling an expensive hashing function (e.g., `createHash("sha256")`) can provide significant performance improvements in high-throughput filtering functions.
**Action:** Always reorder conditionals in filtering loops to evaluate the least expensive checks first. Avoid performing heavy computations (like hashing) on items that are going to be discarded anyway based on a simpler rule.
