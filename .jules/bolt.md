## 2023-08-20 - Delay Expensive Crypto Hashing
**Learning:** Checking fast O(1) `Set` lookups before calling an expensive hashing function (e.g., `createHash("sha256")`) can provide significant performance improvements in high-throughput filtering functions.
**Action:** Always reorder conditionals in filtering loops to evaluate the least expensive checks first. Avoid performing heavy computations (like hashing) on items that are going to be discarded anyway based on a simpler rule.
